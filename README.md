# Get current balance
balance = tracker.get_wallet_balance()
print(f"Balance: {balance}")

# Get transaction history
transactions = tracker.get_transaction_history(limit=50)
print(f"Total transactions: {len(transactions)}")

# Analyze suspicious activities
suspicious = tracker.analyze_suspicious_activity(transactions)
for sus in suspicious:
    print(f"Suspicious: {sus['reason']}")

# Generate report
report = tracker.generate_report("report.txt")
```

### Real-time Monitoring

```python
